## // MNIST Agent -- Reference Design #1
# 
# A 1D application of an Agent trained on small samples of MNIST: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database
# 
# We've gotten Agents with between 20-60%+ accuracy having trained on only 120 training examples (instead of the full 60,000),
# the variance depends on how their neurons are connected (fully connecting an Agent with neurons of this mangnitude was prohbitive for our small machines 
# and unoptimized code, hence the "rand_conn" connector function)
#
# For interactive visual representation of this Arch:
#    https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVM_kESvI=/?share_link_id=72701488535


description = "788-neuron MNIST Agent for benchmarking"      #    MNIST is in grayscale, which we downscaled to B&W for the simple 28x28 neuron count -- 788 = 28x28 + 4
arch_i = [28*28]               # note that the 784 I neurons are in 1 input channel; MNIST is like a single channel clam, so it's limitations are obvious from the prespective of our approach, more on this here: 
arch_z = [4]                   # 4 neurons in 1 channel as 4 binary digits encodes up to integer 16, and only 10 (0-9) are needed for MNIST
arch_c = []
connector_function = "rand_conn"
connector_parameters = [100, 30, 100, 4]
# so all Q neurons are connected randomly to 100 I and 30 neighbor Q
#and all Z neurons are connected randomly to 100 Q and 4 (or all) neighbor Z

# varying these architecture details has been explored in this WIP research paper: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1p3FvYYPsD9XunJg2Dfaw0wLvnxIUspPsMvBi8acp0EI/edit
