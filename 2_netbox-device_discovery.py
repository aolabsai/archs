## // Netbox- Device Discovery -- Reference Design #2
# 
# Our first practically useful Agent, a simple 40 neuron Agent (a 10-factor scale-up of our 4-neuron Basic Clam)
# trained on instances of Netbox to predict Roles of new devices given local device configuration of live devices.
# In simpler words, an Agent to answer the question, "what Role is this new device {Router, Patch Panel, Access Port} like to be given its info and the current devices we have?" 
#
# For interactive visual representation of this Arch:
#    https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVM_kESvI=/?share_link_id=72701488535
#
# Customize and upload this Arch to our API to create Agents: https://docs.aolabs.ai/reference/kennelcreate
#

# using 10 binary neurons to encode integer IDs means we can encode up to 2^10 = 1048 unique binary values.

# To maintain compatability with our API, do not change the variable name "Arch" or the constructor class "ao.Arch" in the line below (the API is pre-loaded with a version of the Arch class in this repo's main branch, hence "ao.Arch")
